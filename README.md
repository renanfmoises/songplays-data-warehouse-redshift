# Data Warehouse with Amazon Redshift

## Motivation

[TO-DO]

## Introduction: The Business Case

A music streaming startup, **Sparkify**, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud.

Their data resides in **AWS S3**, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The objective of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that:

- extracts their data from S3;
- stages them in Redshift; and
- transforms data into a set of dimensional tables

This way the Analytics team can continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Datasets

### Songs Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```python
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

```json
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

### Logs Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```python
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.

```json
{
    "artist": "Olivia Ruiz",
    "auth": "Logged In",
    "firstName": "Jahiem",
    "gender": "M",
    "itemInSession": 3,
    "lastName": "Miles",
    "length": 254.74567,
    "level": "free",
    "location": "San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX",
    "method": "PUT",
    "page": "NextSong",
    "registration": 1540817347796.0,
    "sessionId": 42,
    "song": "Cabaret Blanco",
    "status": 200,
    "ts": 1541300540796,
    "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit\/537.36   (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"",
    "userId": "43"
}
```

## Database Schema

Using the song and log datasets, a star schema has been developed that was optimized for song data analysis queries. The `create_tables.py` script creates the sparkifydb database and the following tables.

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`:

   - `songplay_id`;
   - `start_time`;
   - `user_id`;
   - `level`;
   - `song_id`;
   - `artist_id`;
   - `session_id`;
   - `location`;
   - `user_agent`.

### Dimension Tables

1. **users** - users in the app

    - `user_id`;
    - `first_name`;
    - `last_name`;
    - `gender`;
    - `level`.

2. **songs** - songs in music database

    - `song_id`;
    - `title`;
    - `artist_id`;
    - `year`;
    - `duration`.

3. **artists** - artists in music database

    - `artist_id`;
    - `name`;
    - `location`;
    - `latitude`;
    - `longitude`.

4. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

    - `start_time`;
    - `hour`;
    - `day`;
    - `week`;
    - `month`;
    - `year`;
    - `weekday`.


To run the `create_tables.py` script, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
python create_tables.py
```

## ETL Pipeline

The `etl.py` script implements an ETL pipeline to extract data from the log files and inserts the data into the appropriate tables. To run the etl.py script, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
python etl.py
```

The `sql_queries.py` script contains all of the required SQL queries and statements to create the tables and to insert data. The `create_tables.py` and `etl.py` scripts import the SQL, so the `sql_queries.py` script does not need to run directly.

## Sample Queries

- Query the most active users:

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) activity_cnt
FROM songplays
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

- Query the most common user level:

```sql
SELECT level, COUNT(level) level_cnt
FROM songplays
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY level
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

- Query the most popular user agent:

```sql
SELECT user_agent, COUNT(*) agent_cnt
FROM songplays
WHERE user_agent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_agent
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
